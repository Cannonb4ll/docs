1. Extend your user model from the Firepit User model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Firepit\Cms\Models\User as FirepitUser;

class User extends FirepitUser
{
}
```

Add this class to the `$middleware` array:

```php
Route::middleware([\Firepit\Cms\Http\Middleware\SiteMiddleware::class])->group(function(){
    // Your routes
});
```

If you're using multi-language, also add this middleware:

```php
\Firepit\Cms\Http\Middleware\SiteLanguageMiddleware::class
```
