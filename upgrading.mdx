## Updating the package

You can just run `composer update` or `composer update firepit/cms` to update the package.

You must also run `php artisan cms:upgrade` so all new assets and migrations will be run.

If you want to automate this, you can enter this into your composer.json scripts section:

```json
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "post-update-cmd" : [
            "@php artisan cms:upgrade"
        ],
        ...
    },
```
